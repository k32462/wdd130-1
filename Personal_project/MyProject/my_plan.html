      <h3>Car Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        The car being researched is a 2019 Toyota Corolla SE. It was initially bought in 2020 for $20,000 with 18,000 miles previously driven. This is the point marked in blue. I plan to sell my car at 125,000 miles. At this point in the regression, it is estimated to be sold at a price of $12,465, which is shown in green.
